## About this Challenge 

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This challenge was made with the best of me, when I started to learn a bit more about CSS flexbox.

Another feature I'd like to mention, is the responsive design, which was made with special attention.

Feel free to check this out and contact-me to give a feedbak if you want, so that I can improve more later.
